# Experiment_SpaceTime_VR

This is the Unity project file for the experiment we setup to examine the influence of space on time perception.

## Installation

[Here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) is a guide on how to open the project in Unity.

To make the project work, one has to add "room-latin-square.csv" which is in the repository in the directory "LatinSquareTable"

When working in Unity, one has to add this file at following path:
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\ProjectName\Experiment Time Perception

When running the APK on the Oculus Quest 2, the path is:
Quest:\Android\data\ProjectName\files\Experiment Time Perception

## How to use the Program

Either install this project in Unity, connect it to VR and start it there, or download the APK, install it on the VR-Glasses and start it through VR.

To reproduce the time the lamp has shined, press the B button (primary Button) on the right controller.
To switch to the next room after three time reproduction tasks, one has to press the trigger button on the right controller.
